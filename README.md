# Machine Learning Basics Project

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly machine learning projects, focusing on foundational models and algorithms. The goal is to help learners understand how core machine learning methods work through code and examples.

## Contents

### 2. Linear Regression in Machine Learning

This section covers the basics of linear regression, including:

- Simple linear regression
- Multiple linear regression
- Evaluation metrics like MAE, MSE, and R¬≤
- Implementation using Python and scikit-learn

### 3. Logistic Regression in Machine Learning

In this part, we introduce logistic regression for classification problems, including:

- Binary and multi-class classification
- Sigmoid function and decision boundary
- Model training and performance evaluation
- Practical example with datasets

### 4. Clustering in Machine Learning

Here, we explore unsupervised learning through clustering techniques:

- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Choosing the number of clusters (Elbow method)
- Data visualization of clustering results

## üîÑ Future Updates

This repository is actively maintained and will be updated regularly with:

- More machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, SVM, etc.)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques
- Real-world datasets and project examples
- Notes and explanations for better understanding

Feel free to ‚≠ê star this repo to stay updated!
